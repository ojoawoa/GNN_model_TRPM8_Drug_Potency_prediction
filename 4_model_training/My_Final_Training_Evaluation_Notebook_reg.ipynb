    "# Full Cross-Validation and Final Training Evaluation Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a complete workflow for training, evaluating, and visualizing the performance of a **Graph Attention Network (GAT)** for graph-based regression or classification tasks. The workflow includes cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, ensemble averaging, and final model evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 Workflow Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Imports and Setup**\n",
    "- Load essential libraries: PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.\n",
    "- Configure plotting and file management tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Task and Reproducibility Setup**\n",
    "- Define the task: `classification` or `regression`.\n",
    "- Set a fixed random seed for reproducibility.\n",
    "- Specify class names (for classification) and configure result directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Model Definition**\n",
    "- Define an **GAT Model**\n",
    "- The model processes node and edge features and outputs predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Evaluation Helper Function**\n",
    "- Implements an `evaluate(model, loader)` function to compute predictions and ground truths for a given dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Input Dimensions and Device Setup**\n",
    "- Automatically determine input feature dimensions from the dataset.\n",
    "- Detect and assign the appropriate device (CPU or GPU).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**\n",
    "- Perform a grid search over hyperparameters:\n",
    "    - Hidden dimensions\n",
    "    - Dropout rates\n",
    "    - Learning rates\n",
    "- Train and validate the model across multiple folds, logging metrics for each configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Cross-Validation Training**\n",
    "- Train the model across 10 folds using pre-split datasets.\n",
    "- Log metrics for each fold:\n",
    "    - **Regression**: MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²\n",
    "    - **Classification**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, AUC-ROC\n",
    "- Save fold-wise results to a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Ensemble Averaging**\n",
    "- Combine predictions from all fold models using ensemble averaging.\n",
    "- Evaluate the ensemble on the test set and compute metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Final Model Training**\n",
    "- Merge all training and validation folds into a single dataset.\n",
    "- Reserve a small validation split for early stopping.\n",
    "- Train the final model with:\n",
    "    - Early stopping (based on validation loss)\n",
    "    - Learning rate scheduler\n",
    "    - Model checkpointing (saves the best model)\n",
    "- Evaluate the final model on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **Visualization**\n",
    "- Generate plots for:\n",
    "    - Cross-validation metrics (e.g., MAE, MSE, RMSE, R² per fold)\n",
    "    - Ensemble predictions vs. true values\n",
    "    - Final model predictions vs. true values\n",
    "- Save plots and metrics to the results directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Outputs\n",
    "1. **Cross-Validation Results**:\n",
    "     - Fold-wise metrics saved to `crossval_summary.csv`.\n",
    "     - Bar charts for fold-wise metrics.\n",
    "     - Mean ± standard deviation summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ensemble Results**:\n",
    "     - Ensemble predictions and metrics.\n",
    "     - Scatter plot of ensemble predictions vs. true values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Final Model Results**:\n",
    "     - Final model predictions and metrics.\n",
    "     - Scatter plot of final model predictions vs. true values.\n",
    "     - Saved final model weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 How to Run\n",
    "1. Ensure all dependencies are installed:\n",
    "     - PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric, scikit-learn, matplotlib, numpy, pandas.\n",
    "2. Prepare your dataset in the required format (node features, edge features, labels).\n",
    "3. Configure the task (`classification` or `regression`) and hyperparameters in the notebook.\n",
    "4. Execute the notebook step-by-step to train, evaluate, and visualize the model.\n",

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",
