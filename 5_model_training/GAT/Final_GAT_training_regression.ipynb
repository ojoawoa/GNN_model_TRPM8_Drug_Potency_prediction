    "# Full Cross-Validation and Final Training Evaluation Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a complete workflow for training, evaluating, and visualizing the performance of a **Graph Attention Network (GAT)** for graph-based regression or classification tasks. The workflow includes cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, ensemble averaging, and final model evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 Workflow Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Imports and Setup**\n",
    "- Load essential libraries: PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.\n",
    "- Configure plotting and file management tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Task and Reproducibility Setup**\n",
    "- Define the task: `classification` or `regression`.\n",
    "- Set a fixed random seed for reproducibility.\n",
    "- Specify class names (for classification) and configure result directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Model Definition**\n",
    "- Define an **GAT Model**\n",
    "- The model processes node and edge features and outputs predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Evaluation Helper Function**\n",
    "- Implements an `evaluate(model, loader)` function to compute predictions and ground truths for a given dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Input Dimensions and Device Setup**\n",
    "- Automatically determine input feature dimensions from the dataset.\n",
    "- Detect and assign the appropriate device (CPU or GPU).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**\n",
    "- Perform a grid search over hyperparameters:\n",
    "    - Hidden dimensions\n",
    "    - Dropout rates\n",
    "    - Learning rates\n",
    "- Train and validate the model across multiple folds, logging metrics for each configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Cross-Validation Training**\n",
    "- Train the model across 10 folds using pre-split datasets.\n",
    "- Log metrics for each fold:\n",
    "    - **Regression**: MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²\n",
    "    - **Classification**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, AUC-ROC\n",
    "- Save fold-wise results to a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Ensemble Averaging**\n",
    "- Combine predictions from all fold models using ensemble averaging.\n",
    "- Evaluate the ensemble on the test set and compute metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Final Model Training**\n",
    "- Merge all training and validation folds into a single dataset.\n",
    "- Reserve a small validation split for early stopping.\n",
    "- Train the final model with:\n",
    "    - Early stopping (based on validation loss)\n",
    "    - Learning rate scheduler\n",
    "    - Model checkpointing (saves the best model)\n",
    "- Evaluate the final model on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **Visualization**\n",
    "- Generate plots for:\n",
    "    - Cross-validation metrics (e.g., MAE, MSE, RMSE, R² per fold)\n",
    "    - Ensemble predictions vs. true values\n",
    "    - Final model predictions vs. true values\n",
    "- Save plots and metrics to the results directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Outputs\n",
    "1. **Cross-Validation Results**:\n",
    "     - Fold-wise metrics saved to `crossval_summary.csv`.\n",
    "     - Bar charts for fold-wise metrics.\n",
    "     - Mean ± standard deviation summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ensemble Results**:\n",
    "     - Ensemble predictions and metrics.\n",
    "     - Scatter plot of ensemble predictions vs. true values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Final Model Results**:\n",
    "     - Final model predictions and metrics.\n",
    "     - Scatter plot of final model predictions vs. true values.\n",
    "     - Saved final model weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 How to Run\n",
    "1. Ensure all dependencies are installed:\n",
    "     - PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric, scikit-learn, matplotlib, numpy, pandas.\n",
    "2. Prepare your dataset in the required format (node features, edge features, labels).\n",
    "3. Configure the task (`classification` or `regression`) and hyperparameters in the notebook.\n",
    "4. Execute the notebook step-by-step to train, evaluate, and visualize the model.\n",
